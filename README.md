# calculator


## Introduction
This a simple calculator app that provides the following functionality: 
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication 
* Division

This app is different than other calculator apps because it is so simple. sometimes you dont
want so much functionality, you just want a quick and simple way to do simple math.

## What I learned
This was my first app that was fully functional. I learned about Swift variables, enums, IBOutlets, IBActions.
